Create a program that simulates using Flashcards to test math skills.

Specifically, your main function should generate at least 10 Flashcards that have math facts.

It should support random integers as operands (You can limit between 0 and 100 if you want).
It should support +,-,* and /

All numbers (including answers to division problems should be integers)
25/5 is a valid problem  26/5  is not.  
(Tip - start by generating the denominator and then derive a valid numerator)

Note:   The point of this activity is to seem inheritance/polymorphic relationships. 
You should have an abstract flashcard class and then derive a subclass for each operator.
